git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce_dashboard.git
cd ecommerce_dashboard
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with your Supabase credentials:

```env
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
